# Theme Evolution System

A scalable system that solves **large-scale batch processing with several million responses exceeding LLM context windows** by intelligently chunking datasets, maintaining theme consistency across batches, and evolving themes over time using vector-based similarity matching.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-command setup (downloads models, sets up database, launches UI)
docker-compose up
```

**What happens automatically:**
- 🗄️ PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- 🤖 Ollama with Llama 3.1 and nomic-embed-text models
- 📊 Database schema setup
- 🌐 Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501
