# Project Proposal

**Project Title:** Theme Evolution System for Survey Response Analysis

**Team Members:** Arnab Karmakar (arnabk3)

**Project Coordinator:** Arnab Karmakar (arnabk3)

## Project Description

This project aims to develop an intelligent theme evolution system that processes survey responses in batches, automatically extracts themes, highlights contributing keywords, and intelligently evolves themes over time using local LLM processing.

### 1. What is the new tool or new function that you'd like to develop?

A scalable theme extraction and evolution system that:
- **Processes survey responses in batches** with automatic theme identification
- **Highlights keywords** that contribute to theme assignment using similarity-based analysis
- **Evolves themes intelligently** over time through merging, splitting, and updating
- **Applies retroactive updates** to historical data when themes change
- **Provides comprehensive analytics** on theme evolution and response patterns

### 2. Why do we need it? What pain point does it address?

**Critical Technical Challenge:**
- **LLM Context Window Limitations**: Even advanced LLMs cannot handle several million survey responses
- **Large-Scale Processing**: Survey datasets with millions of responses exceed LLM context windows
- **Memory Constraints**: Processing entire datasets causes memory overflow and performance issues
- **Theme Consistency**: Need to maintain theme coherence across large datasets

**Our Solution:**
- **Intelligent Batching**: Process large datasets in optimal chunks that fit LLM context windows
- **Vector-Based Similarity**: Use embeddings for efficient theme matching without full context
- **Theme Evolution**: Maintain and update themes across batches with retroactive updates
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle datasets of any size through intelligent chunking

### 3. How is this different from existing tools?

**Existing Tools Limitations:**
- **Single-shot LLM analysis** cannot handle several million responses
- **Static analysis tools** require manual coding and don't scale to large datasets
- **Basic clustering** doesn't provide semantic understanding or theme evolution
- **Survey platforms** only provide basic analytics, no theme evolution

**Our Innovation:**
- **Intelligent batching** that maintains semantic coherence across chunks
- **Vector-based theme evolution** using embeddings for efficient similarity matching
- **Incremental processing** that scales to several million responses
- **Retroactive updates** that maintain historical consistency across batches

### 4. How do you plan to build your tool?

**Core Technical Solution:**
- **Intelligent Batching**: Process responses in optimal chunks that fit LLM context windows
- **Vector-Based Similarity**: Use embeddings to match responses to themes without full context
- **Incremental Processing**: Maintain theme state across batches using database persistence
- **Retroactive Updates**: Update historical themes when new patterns emerge

**Architecture:**
- **Batch Processor**: Orchestrates chunking and processing workflow
- **Theme Extractor**: LLM integration for theme generation within context limits
- **Vector Database**: PostgreSQL + pgvector for efficient similarity search
- **Theme Evolver**: Merge/split/update logic with retroactive processing
- **Embedding Service**: Batch embedding generation and caching

**Key Technical Innovations:**
1. **Intelligent Batching**: Process large datasets in optimal chunks that fit LLM context windows
2. **Vector-Based Similarity**: Use embeddings for efficient theme matching without full context
3. **Theme Evolution**: Maintain and update themes across batches with retroactive updates
4. **Scalable Processing**: Handle datasets of any size through intelligent chunking

### 5. How do you plan to evaluate your tool?

**Evaluation Approach:**
- **Performance Testing**: Measure processing speed, memory usage, and scalability with datasets of varying sizes
- **Accuracy Testing**: Compare theme extraction results against manual coding and baseline methods
- **Scalability Testing**: Test with large datasets (1M+ responses) to verify context window handling
- **Metrics**: Use quantitative measures like throughput, similarity scores, and statistical validation
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against single-shot LLM processing and existing tools

### 6. How do you plan to divide the work among team members?

**Solo Project Structure:**
- **Phase 1**: Core system architecture and database design
- **Phase 2**: LLM integration and theme extraction logic
- **Phase 3**: Keyword highlighting and similarity algorithms
- **Phase 4**: Theme evolution and retroactive update logic
- **Phase 5**: Testing, documentation, and deployment setup
