- Check system resources
- Restart services: `docker-compose restart`

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
docker-compose up
```

### Reset Everything

If you encounter persistent issues:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Optimization
- Generate questions that are specific and focused
- Process batches regularly to see theme evolution
- Use the analysis tab to understand patterns

### 2. Data Management
- Clear data between different experiments
- Monitor processing metrics for performance
- Export results for external analysis

### 3. Theme Analysis
- Focus on high-confidence themes
- Review keyword highlights for insights
- Track theme evolution over multiple batches

## Integration

### API Access
The system also provides programmatic access:
```python
from src.theme_processor import ThemeProcessor
processor = ThemeProcessor()
result = processor.process_batch(batch_data)
```

### Database Queries
Direct database access for advanced analysis:
```python
from src.database import DatabaseManager
db = DatabaseManager()
themes = db.get_all_themes()
```
